Cogs 18 Final Project, chatbot
This is my final project I did for my Cogs 18 (Intro to Python) course. It was a culmination of previous asssignments that were done in class, and brought together where we incorporated our own ideas to solve a problem or enhance an existing feature in python. I decided to create a chatbot that allowed the user to select a language to talk to my chatbot in. Thank you for taking the time to visit and read this very brief description of my project.
